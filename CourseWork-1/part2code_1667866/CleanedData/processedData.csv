music best last  years maybe cunning make timescale include stairway heaven bohemian rhapsody kind make bit hollow award really not much competition last  years all its alright pop song  best song last  years there way earth song voted best last  yearsits travesty rubbish who voted included list i regular listener radio  i recall invitation vote bland slushy rubbish might appeal masses know good song jumped bit nose certainly not best song last  years how depressing thought manufactured pop way  earth dreadful list appear from while i biassed i thought love will tear us apart won seriousness i think best song last  years include songs less  years old would exclude songs popular novelty then again well done robbie good show youve got kidding angels great song best song last  years only best song nomination brits i think angels great song deserved run award i think best song past  years right enough better others catergory example will young nominated first place  alright song good im happy robbie though best song last  years what joke think great rock pop songs released s pretty much better angels phil collins deserve awards good songs wrote angels overrated song got tiresome even finished listening it soppy rubbish best hopefully manufactured rubbish die soon let real artists worked hard glory receive awards so boringly obvious typical bland nature mainstream music britain today proof music democracy mix still least will young oh bit fun people take awards seriously robbie millions loyal fans even nonfans know words angels him winning obviously reflects votes awards personally i wanted will young win really due musical talent i hate song brings back memories school discos noone slowdance with i agree angels i never get fed hearing it whenever song comes radio i turn radio up smile sing along very badly radio turned drown voice out the song makes calm serene happy well done robbie i think although robbie williams good performer angels really good song it certainly anywhere near good love will tear us apart joy division wuthering heights kate bush angels fantastic song all credit robbie williams guy chambers its song played forever bridges age groups robbie way deserve mantle whenever awards always artists past five years seem win best bestwe forget late s early s example they cool time cool shows songs greater longevity people think yes angels best song since past  years touches soul carries lot meaning ive always disliked angels intensely i believe symbolic general capacity british preteens teens middle aged women accept low quality low aspirational music classic songwriting its orrible it seems obvious people like robbie people particularly like music much folks without collections folks never engaged madness one experiences falling spell pop music angels adds nothing  merely irritating distraction  wasp refuses go away summers afternoon picnic what dreadful result if voted  feel ashamed  probably know dozen songs  get applying uninformed filter casting ridiculous vote booo hisss angels best song you kidding right last five years i might willing accept  way did whoever voted actually any music knowledge prior to say  really quite insulting british music industry past quarter century no surprise robbie williams considering list where earth nominations list come from compiled eleven yearold girl perhaps i mean will young come on what load crap best song last  years  i think so what real artists last  years  list endless robbie williams even come close what joke that song become bane i developed pavlovian response word angels i thrash around scream no no someone tells the radios off why halfbaked cheesy ditty like angels become anthem millions romantic sops think many times sung pop idol example whom voted best song past  years beyond me if song others judged musicians may well give up why reward mediocrity highly country the initial list weak anyway angels best song last  years i think not i realize radio  many listeners age  people short memories a great song yes best last  years not chance i think person opposed song voted here the great british public work again its mediocre sentimental safe song granted bad either but stand anything the smiths in particular how soon now anything stone roses first album nope no because im female im  ok i like robbie angels decent song but way best song past  years the shortlist great winning joke predictable laughable the success angels years brits reflects poorly state british music last  years the british public brainwashed corporate pulp presneted cutting edge music true talent sadly missed whilst angels popular song even best song robbies repertoire never mind best song last  years i huge robbie fan love song but i think lot outstanding songs  music influenced music today unfortunately left list have radio  listeners even heard joy division a band who two albums bigger impact music continue so last  years robbie williams ever will no doubt it theres song done anyone emotion feeling some people adopt slightly snobby stances angels hit home far larger audience song it joy divisionthose guys played influential part shaping modern day music angels remains yet another pop song i sincerely believe  years now influential artists argue robbie williams inspired art way byrds beatles nick drake done music today yes i think brilliantly written song different meanings different people there great songs category somebody win robbie deserved winner i astounded secondrate record beaten line amazing songs terrible song voted masses brains appreciate innovative exciting music the best song past  years really come on surely joke no i think i need long lie down it goes show british public clue good quality music pick robbie williams beautifully talented kate bush joy division i suppose confirmed one thing  british public consistently dull  lt no offence robbie pleeease there must thousand better songs formulated cheesy pop song kids no one agrees quite frankly embarassment integrity british music nail coffin i think robbie deserves it iconic stars britain since john lennon idol millions worldwide anybody says deserve jealous success the real challenger queen hey another one bites dust obviously karaoke singers uk voted it if best song last  years british music industry trouble sure robbie talented produces excellent material best record a sad day music its type music i normally like even diehard rock fan i recognise good song appelas people thats voted best song last  years its good allrounder just like robbie best song  years since  im confused angels bad song its nice catchy formulaic anthem ticks boxes but great music if anything regressive bland even i suppose evidence redundant brit awards become granted angels good song however really proper competition the queens song lackluster apart kate bush choices pathetic also stones there david bowie etc many greater songs angelsi wonder simply fact robbie getting awards make one him best song last  years what ridiculuous concept even ridiculous winner sigh on upside least bohemian rhapsody thankful angels without doubt great song i really think deserves title best song  yearsperhaps vote teenage opinion robbies goodlooks actual song dont get wrong im disputing looks deserved winners it would travesty angels won without angels robbie williams may well now britain would deprived one charismatic talented performing artists it seen performed live  people singing along fully appreciated well done rob i find hard believe angels best show past  years im rapidly redifining best head mean most gratuitously played weddings funerals people think deep meaning what britpop blur oasis suede pulp making fantastic songs also making changes something different why must best always come commercially popular ive nothing robbie i actually like music possibly best song last year the brits proved nothing bargaining tool pop moguls boost band profiles record sales the goes scissor sisters i think superb record thoroughly deserves newcomer award album comes near us new record neither league once baffling discisions made artisic reasons profit no surprise really voted general public since taste music personally i find angels robbie williams one irritating songs i ever heard it absolutely deserved win it song united generations continue played many years come its absolute joke however original  poor choices well all pretty pointless exercise  the song overplayed oversentimental out rather poor five choices left gone either joy division queen i suppose thankful end hands will young though although nostalgia value way deserved win everybody knows words bohemian rhapsody nothing compares  u etc much better songs timeless give someone real talent although angels good song i think anyone slightest musical taste realise best song last  years this another example record company manipulation keep artist public eye why give award greatest pair trousers thats means\r\nentertainment,jamelias return top rb star jamelia three brit nominations go triple triumph last years mobo awards the birminghamborn

acknowledging theres urban music scene kick teeth end day its really relevant if joss stone closest thing feel comfortable championing looks like sounds signed to it its got nothing whats really going on urban genre broad if look underneath urban number core elements include hiphop rb garage obviously comes soul joss stone soul artist her first album called the soul sessions so urban broad brushstroke umbrella top subgenres offshoots those joss stone amazing success in us given uk artist what really captured everybodys imagination yearold devon voice die bunch really really good tunes

interesting thing music cover made large cities literally rural the great thing urban music theres big range if sort root black music dance music britain i think thats call urban  thats new

judge people what urban means us organisation politically correct term describe music originated black background music become inclusive fighting multicultural britain fighting inclusion rather exclusion if joss stone accepted within urban music community i think acts ethnicities classical music rock accepted too race make difference everyone included out awards dished yesterday im still trying find people races received sort recognition award a type music especially street music originates city typically reflects characteristic urban life she might urban rb become hip hop tainted thing now rb stands rhythm and blues remember that joss stone rubbish certain if anyone deserves win award urban music i think probably include hiphop soul  funk least rock pop year streets although dizzee rascal stakes good claim she definitely deserved win prize joss stones albums quite simply amazing easily better anything else released last year this whole debate urban isnt urban completely pointless probably fueled urban artists nominated win i cant see people cant congratulate talent is she deserve it i agree comments urban music its stupid phrase particularly british in states tend use hip hop rb i say hip hop lot people idea im talking about very strange whats name a rose name etc if people want call urban not if really analysed it term dance music misleading describe everything dance to whilst i agree term urban open interpretation strikes simply weird joss stone won urban i hear played parties inner cities  i live brixton never heard the soul sessions pumping bass heavy sound system parties ive to good luck joss stone lets celebrate victory  lets also question why artists successful talented jamelia lemar kanye west dizzee rascal alicia keys outkast  see

urban music in truth lazy term categorise music really understand soul garage worlds apart musically marvin gaye v tuff jam doubt connections if let music speak judge success artist number awards won

urban music category simply acknowledge artists making historically considered urban music irrelevent colour skin originate from joss stone simply singing certain type music considered urban style someone inner city indeed usa could sing country music if person good authentic sound would criticise referred country music artist representing style the term urban reference music genre uk developed part controversy surrounding branding mobo awards the term music black origin confused offended many people this particularly strange given existence asian music awards it appears use black white relation music makes people feel uncomfortable the term urban therefore invoked sidestep debate type music came first black white thereby rendering issue colourblind the result redundant new debate urban also means perhaps created new term altogether describe various strains soulrnb hiphop one also mean something else  done crunk urban word thats come recently describe black music thats become popular now the word even use common use five six years ago its way industry clumping together without call black music people oversensitive might call racist it im band called urban i despise label

even careful consideration experienced judge whim political activist called government minister to protected terror government says must become tyranny but tyranny based citizens terror this victory defeat shot fired an interesting article  good see widening participation debate  i suggest move one step further our bombs bullets shatter peace invading foreign nations imprisoning innocent hunting shadows cannot destroy evil mind hatred within heart rather focusing upon effect consider cause terrorism begin bombs why try foreign policy compassion enhance democracy share freedom i agree frederick forsyth we really cant deal terrorism turning britain fascist state what really need honesty security services politicians if evidence bring people trial probably any our security services behave like detective decided certain person guilty rakes kinds obscure flimsy evidence try prove it real villain gets away remember wmd iraq just person may made stupid naive decisions life make terrorist in overly politically correct society good see someone like mr forsyth speak out yes oppression british government past overstepping mark places like ireland yes still democracy rare

allow ride roughshod rights liberties in end thing seek protect giving name safety invisible enemy the terrorists already won i absolutely agree frederick forsyth yes defend terrorism existing laws seem adequate the idea new terrorism demands new powers erroneous the evidence real terrorist capability uk scant ricin example dangerous poison weapon mass destruction what really worrying enthusiasm mr blair government authoritarian reactions attempts manipulate electorate fear if government way id cards tracking totalitarianism matters little whether give terrorists demands not we lost precious freedom bush blair constantly tells us seek bring others i agree wholeheartedly mr forsyth i shocked ease government prepared wipe major portion liberties british people enjoyed centuries  right deprived liberty without trial open court that goes right back magna carta ordinary people spilled blood enforce right governments thought knew best when look todays britain realise george orwell wrong one thing date frederick forsyth puts beautifully the government seeking introduce police state the new powers home internment without trial follow pattern includes introduction surveillance via compulsory id cards linking data bases together unbritish idea swear allegiance state age  years we sleepwalking this wake up an interesting view missing two crucial facts new threat  if terrorists acquire weapons mass destruction will use without fear mutually assured destruction kept cold war state tense balance these people use devastating force us without fear any consequence  the terrorists prepared use suicide bombers means could kill innocent people london underground could little stop it because terrorists potentially so deadly come new tougher responses it little late day people outside london wake one morning find london nuked we much society left debate  hes correct says mind seem forgotten disgraceful internment policy northern ireland probably caused many idealistic misguided young catholics join ira administrative detention muslims could similar effect now surely public would better protected security services rather alerting suspect terrorist placing house arrest and longthey place suspect terrorist surveillance maybe acquire sufficient evidence prosecute even better prevent terrorist attack i usually much time mr forsyths largely right wing views time got spot on there doubt terrorist organisations would like harm uk doubtful whether alqaeda global organisation coordinating this the rise surveillance cameras id cards plan charge road use tracking every vehicle times stuff nightmares add new legislation effectively means protection law removed anyone whim home secretary i genuinely wonder sort world two children inherit where end as stands terrorists need attack uk government soon people terrorised could achieve bombs mr forsyth expressed exactly gut fears reservations proposed legislation could verbalise thank you mr forsyth seems forget killings troubles occurred sides religious divide carried killers sides he also forgets basic human rights suspended now experienced judges sat greatest miscarriages justice times for little return maximum alienation these laws emphasis islamic threat same forsyth wrong the nature current threat new it longer armed forces soviet threat eastern bloc was it i the terrorist aim kill indiscriminately the best comparison therefore blitz  at time let us forget suspects foreign british routinely rounded interned duration war without complaints public we must forget war id say likelihood attack sleeper cell fundamentalist lunatics major uk target when if probability ill bet money like day attack freddie forsyth saying government enough protect uk people like forsyth see one side argument side opposite new labour tony blair i agree wholeheartedly mr forsyth the reason country wonderful place live attack terrorists government the perpetuation perceived terrorist threat alleged terrorists doing government i believe government doing is least highly questionable worst sinister at point feel enough control every single person british isles tagged monitored constantly our freedom craftily surreptitiously whittled away government gaining nothing it great concern everyone i slightly older mr forsyth therefore lived history him i police state would like think i lived one i think attack iraq made international situation worse may provoked acts terrorism how true there extremely worrying parallels britain germany s i never thought would easy take country within mr forsyth forgotten one key point terrorists threaten britain today well aware hitler stalin ira failed as result modern day terrorists willing things predecessors not that mean civil liberties modern britain must eroded counter threat always absolute last resort but meet new threat defeat sinister fanaticism todays terrorists may need things little differently let us hope not frederic forsythes comments seem wellthoughtout analysis human society whole britain particular resist temptation overprotect fear it fear enables terrorists succeed end terrorists come forms mr forsythes opening comments suggest i reminded quote attributed thomas jefferson a nation limits freedom name security neither the government faced incredibly difficult task made policy deal it its well criticising policy mr forsythe cant draw years experience offer alternative i say so what opinions frederick forsyths rhetoric absurd conclusions laughable he distorts reality serve prejudice new labour this government seeks balance protection democracy minimum loss civil rights it frederick forsyth extremist appreciate need balance i rarely find agreeing my forsyth instance i think correct the rule law must prevail civil liberties worth defending if government hold suspects without charge trial whats next i agree absolutely by introducing fascist type laws loose moral high ground fight terror our democratic system perfect churchill points better others tried terrorist attacks take place many reasons take personal risk return personal freedom i usually agree mr forsyth spot here the single biggest threat face government dedicated acting illegally manipulating international national law suit purpose totalitarianism always requires outside threat justifying range extraordinary powers leaders want the british government far greater threat terrorist organisation although principle i agree him frederick forsyth fails address one key point alqaeda attacks though obviously none yet uk seek kill maximum number people the ira wanted limit death toll attacks maintain support among republican movement yes i agree mr forsyths views i believe governments plans justified there reaction negative influence us presidents interpretation democracy freedom he uses arguments current wwii wars liberate iraq afghanistan syria iran come we leaving poor inheritance future generations mr forsyth wonderful writer keep fiction belongs the british government going road mr forsyth suggests sadly comments make lot people believe governed people fast becoming tyrants instead genuinely committed stopping tyranny even method employed moment alien british people lived democracy protected tony blair others like mind who mr forsyth seems putting along side scruffy little austrian thomas hobbes would smiling grave labours propositions like new labour called libertarian like new labour believed promoting peoples best interests but forsythe criticises government hobbes criticised subsequent philosophers arguing way hands totalitarians simply put argued favour ultimate liberty  liberty live  man prepared surrender liberties supreme sovereign protection fellow barbaric man hobbes roundly condemned posterity rightly so i hope new labour suffers treatment i agree mr forsyths views the governments approach totally spirit british democracy they must allowed get away it of course frederick wrong britain winning war ira hes wrong country becoming tyranny has forgotten shoot kill torture internment without trial collusion loyalist death squads etc my background somewhat similar freddies i persuaded agree many sentiments we moral justification imposing system government anyone systematically depriving citizens basic individual collective freedoms whilst principle keeping potential terrorists house arrest might seem superficially attractive is unfortunately also first step towards totalitarianism who decide suspect why believe them who faith honesty integrity competence intelligence services politicians light events recent years what stop false denunciations what falsely accused lose careers who support families will children still go school it smacks methods nazi germany stalins russia ceausescus romania  list goes on it looks new dark age coming i see opinion mr forsyths remarks divided the problem i see support imprisonment without trial believe never happen family people like scared of but history shown laws like that always get abused power after all today may scared people power someday power may scared you and day one imprisoned without chance justice our laws cannot imprisoned whim police forces shown deserving it if imprison people without trial indeterminate period better fighting i never thought possible agree single word uttered frederick forsyth im wholehearted agreement one we nation grave danger duped pro us propaganda course also means well inherit most total paranoia allow governments political persuasion incidentally gradually insidiously impose police state well tried  tested back door methods i grieve future children wonder theyre adamant ever want own this government much fanfare signs us european convention human rights wants introduce indefinite house arrest without trial this puts par government burma like many respondents i usually think mr forsyth someone whose views i share instance opposing charles clarks proposals house arrest i agree wholeheartedly mr forsyth i agree mr forsyth just look facts  government along us invaded another sovereign country iraq selecting intelligence backed case based fear the facts turned different if individuals treated distorted way weve done damage terrorist organisation could bombs we become animals too i agree many ways mr forsyth said  respected influence within world must seen walking walk well talking talk  accuse countries zimbabwe burma human rights abuses locking people may totally innocent hypocrisy highest order mr forsyth links islamic fundamentalism new threat however appears misunderstood term islamic fundamentalism it pointed muslim adheres true fundamentals quraan teachings last prophet muhammad islamic fundamentalist this person commit suicide shape form shehe kill innocent women men children this person selfreflective constantly tries better herhis actions good others the people mr forsyth labels new threat follow correct teachings islam they arrived interpretations assumptions regards actions on top that claim following islam true form i accept intentions policies make britain safer place i cannot think single example history sort thing ever made difference  northern ireland internment certainly achieve anything  bombings stop could argued achieved supply ira yet angry resentful republicans willing take
